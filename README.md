# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.



this is the answer the question given:

WHAT IS NPM:
NPM is a tools that helps you download and manage the tools your project dependencies needs to work.

WHAT IS PACKAGE.JSON:
Package.json is the file that tells NPM what your project needs and how to run it and also store your project name and data.  

WHAT IS VITE:
Vite is a fast build tool that makes your React project run faster, easier to develop and update your app instantly while you code.

DOM manipulation:

React introduces the component-based approach to building UIs using JSX, props, state, and hooks.

React Hooks make function components powerful, allowing state, side effects, context, and performance optimizations without classes.

JavaScript DOM basics teach you how to interact with HTML elements and page structure — the underlying foundation that React abstracts away.

Understanding both React and the DOM gives you a strong basis for building interactive, dynamic web applications.
